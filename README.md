# COSC264-TCP-assignment
Cosc264 assignment 1

This is a porject I created while in my second year of university studying computer engineering

This is a simple TCP file sharing project that contains a server and a client all coded in python.

If any other cosc264 students find this project, feel free to look at this code for help but DO NOT COPY IT

thanks
